The basis of electronic assemblies is the printed circuit board. We have many years of experience in the development and design of PCBs. This has involved both [own](https://www.tindie.com/products/l2electron/led-christmastree-or-das-tannenbaumchen/) products and developments on commission. 

The production of prototypes is suitable for the initial evaluation of electronic assemblies. Here we provide support from the conception phase through to the construction and measurement of electronic prototypes.
